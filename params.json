To do that i decided to use SoftwareSerial Library. I was ispired by these projects hosted in Hackster... David Jones Project and Jiong Shi\r\n\r\nNext Step has been to change the Default Name of my Bluetooth device, the Default name was HC-05 ... it's not cool!\r\n\r\nTo do that is necessary use the AT Commands, in this LINK you can find an usefull step by step guideline.\r\nThe communication between Raspberry and Anrduino, as i said, is made up of a blueetooth connection. i decided to implement a method in the UWP application that sends a string that contains 3 character (equivalent to 3 byte) that Arduino receives and then manage the input data.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.hackster.io/lentzlive/chromotherapy-with-raspberry-and-arduino-69d11e\">...
