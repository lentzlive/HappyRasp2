<p>That is the question I asked myself when I thought about the new project to be realized .
Every day I spend many hours working on computer, I would like that the technology "take care" of me, trying to understand my moods and to find a ways to relax and make me happy.
How can my pc interpret my expression and let me be able to make me feel good?
The answer was immediately clear ... using Microsoft Cognitive Services and my favorite gadgets (Raspberry and Arduino).
Let's talk about my project, let's go!</p>

<a id="the-idea" class="anchor" href="#the-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Idea</h3>

<p>In chromotherapy , each color is associated with particular mental and spiritual characteristics of individuals , and supporters believe that the same would have particular effects on the functioning of the body.
Each color is then associated with specific properties , often based on simple psychological analogies.
I created a system able to see my expression, understand if i am happy and decide what is the best color of the room in order to change my mood.</p>

<p>My hardware is below shown.</p>

<p>The first step has been create a comunication between my devices (Raspberry and the Arduino). To do that i decided to use SoftwareSerial Library. I was ispired by these projects hosted in Hackster... David Jones Project and Jiong Shi</p>

<p>Next Step has been to change the Default Name of my Bluetooth device, the Default name was HC-05 ... it's not cool!</p>

<p>To do that is necessary use the AT Commands, in this LINK you can find an usefull step by step guideline.
The communication between Raspberry and Anrduino, as i said, is made up of a blueetooth connection. i decided to implement a method in the UWP application that sends a string that contains 3 character (equivalent to 3 byte) that Arduino receives and then manage the input data.</p>
